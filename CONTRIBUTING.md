Ticket and Pull Request Guidelines
==================================

The policy on issues is:
* Non-committers should discuss issues on the Lift mailing list before opening
  a issue.
* All non-committer issues should have a link back to the mailing list
  discussion that led to opening the issue so the whole world can see why the
  issue came into being.
* All non-committer issues should be set to no milestone, no assignment and
  normal (or lower) priority unless a committer explicitly asked for assignment
  (that means they agreed to do the work).
* A committer may open a issue at whatever priority for whatever milestone and
  assign it to themselves.
* There should be very little discussion about issue in the issuing system.
  The discussion should take place on the Lift list so the discussion is
  available to a broader audience.

We will accept pull requests into the Lift codebase if the pull requests meet
the following criteria:
* The request represents one or more of the following:
  * Documentation including ScalaDoc comments in code
  * Example code
  * Small changes, enhancements, or bug fixes to Liftâ€™s code
* The request includes a signature at the bottom of the /contributors.md file.
